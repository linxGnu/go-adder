/**
 * A package-local class holding common representation and mechanics
 * for classes supporting dynamic striping on 64bit values. The class
 * extends Number so that concrete subclasses must publicly do so.
 */

/*
 * This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically
 * updated variables, plus an extra "base" field. The table size
 * is a power of two. Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes.
 * Nearly all declarations in this class are package-private,
 * accessed directly by subclasses.
 *
 * Table entries are of class Cell; a variant of AtomicLong padded
 * (via @Contended) to reduce cache contention. Padding is
 * overkill for most Atomics because they are usually irregularly
 * scattered in memory and thus don't interfere much with each
 * other. But Atomic objects residing in arrays will tend to be
 * placed adjacent to each other, and so will most often share
 * cache lines (with a huge negative performance impact) without
 * this precaution.
 *
 * In part because Cells are relatively large, we avoid creating
 * them until they are needed.  When there is no contention, all
 * updates are made to the base field.  Upon first contention (a
 * failed CAS on base update), the table is initialized to size 2.
 * The table size is doubled upon further contention until
 * reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal to the
 * number of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (null) until they are
 * needed.
 *
 * A single spinlock ("cellsBusy") is used for initializing and
 * resizing the table, as well as populating slots with new Cells.
 * There is no need for a blocking lock; when the lock is not
 * available, threads try other slots (or the base).  During these
 * retries, there is increased contention and reduced locality,
 * which is still better than alternatives.
 *
 * The Thread probe fields maintained via ThreadLocalRandom serve
 * as per-thread hash codes. We let them remain uninitialized as
 * zero (if they come in this way) until they contend at slot
 * 0. They are then initialized to values that typically do not
 * often conflict with others.  Contention and/or table collisions
 * are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update
 * operation. Upon a collision, if the table size is less than
 * the capacity, it is doubled in size unless some other thread
 * holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is
 * available, a new Cell is created. Otherwise, if the slot
 * exists, a CAS is tried.  Retries proceed by "double hashing",
 * using a secondary hash (Marsaglia XorShift) to try to find a
 * free slot.
 *
 * The table size is capped because, when there are more threads
 * than CPUs, supposing that each thread were bound to a CPU,
 * there would exist a perfect hash function mapping threads to
 * slots that eliminates collisions. When we reach capacity, we
 * search for this mapping by randomly varying the hash codes of
 * colliding threads.  Because search is random, and collisions
 * only become known via CAS failures, convergence can be slow,
 * and because threads are typically not bound to CPUS forever,
 * may not occur at all. However, despite these limitations,
 * observed contention rates are typically low in these cases.
 *
 * It is possible for a Cell to become unused when threads that
 * once hashed to it terminate, as well as in the case where
 * doubling the table causes no thread to hash to it under
 * expanded mask.  We do not try to detect or remove such cells,
 * under the assumption that for long-running instances, observed
 * contention levels will recur, so the cells will eventually be
 * needed again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
